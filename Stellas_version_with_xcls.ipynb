    "This notebook aims to document how to calculate LAVD fields from taking input velocity fields from ICON EERIE runs. After LAVD fields are calculated, RCLVs are identified in the fields. Tracking of the RCLVs is also shown. \n",

    "This notebook is heavily based on Lexi Jones-Kellett (MIT) example_usage.ipynb which is published along with her code. The functions in this notebook are a combination of **RCLVatlas** by Lexi Jones-Kellett (MIT) (https://github.com/lexi-jones/RCLVatlas) and **xlcs** by Philippe Miron (https://github.com/philippemiron/xlcs). Both initially use **Parcels**  (https://github.com/OceanParcels/Parcels) to create the Lagrangian trajectories and the **Floater** (https://github.com/ocean-transport/floater) to identify the RCLVs. \n",

    "My job here is to take the bits that I like from other people's work and alter it to work with the model output data that I have (which I also did not create). So thanks to about a million people for working for years so that I could do this."
